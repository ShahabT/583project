\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
First, we analyze the code blocks at compile stage and extract the strings in
basic blocks that potentially contain queries. With the identified queries, we
speculate tables that are likely used. And then, we propose to prefetch ``mostly
likely to be queried" tables to the main memory. We plan to speculatively
prefetch tables by inserting or moving basic blocks that fetch tables to memory.
Furthermore, we suspect that applications in similar category are likely to
utilize same table. This means that by prefetching and caching the table that is
shared among multiple applications, we remove the bottleneck in traditional
database systems at compiler optimization domain.
